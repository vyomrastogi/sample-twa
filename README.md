#### Team Norm 
  - When a team member is explaining something, no one should interrupt out of context. 
  - Limit the time spent on resolution of a technical issue. Team should come together to resolve the issue even still blocked after _1 hour_. 
  - 

#### Coding Best Practices
  - Every commit should have atleast _85%_ code coverage and we should configure this gatecheck either in build step  
  - Every user story should have it's own feature branch pulled from master
  - CI/CD setup should be the first step after project initialization
